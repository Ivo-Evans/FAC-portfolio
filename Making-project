What I'm going to need?

an array of objects containing state for components, including JSX

A Project component, which is the whole page, and contains two components, NextArrow and ProjectDetail, and aligns them as a flex column

A NextArrow component, which takes a 'to' prop and sets refs accordingly - on hover it goes yellow

A PojectDetail component, which is an article, and which contains two components

A phone component which takes:
- colour (black or white)
- an image 
- A link 
- some alt text (can be title)

A copy component, which takes
- A title
- An array of tech
- Content, a domfrag

Build it from the bottom up, with Storybook, first copy and phone, then ProjectDetail, then put it all together



Sorting out this context issue:
- create and export the context in the src/context.tsx file
- I think the lowest place you can put the context provider is in the Layout component
- After that you'll need to set it in the Nav component <- this is the puzzle right now
- once you've done that you can access it in Project with myVal = useContext(ImportedContext)


OOOOOH, this problem only exists if you refresh the page
